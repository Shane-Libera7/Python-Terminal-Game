## Super Attack Moves
- Each types of character have three attack options, 2 normal attacks and one super attack.
- The super attack for speedster is "super sonic punch", for viltrumites its "orbital strike" and for wizards its "arcane cataclysm"
- The super attacks offer the opponent a window to act, they can either defend or counter attack and it is through random probability which decides whether or not the chosen move will work or not. If the opponent choses to attack, there is a chance that they will end up doing damage instead of suffering damage, but the liklihood of that chosem move working ut is only 30%. Should they chose that move fail, they will suffer even extra damage on top of the base damage of the super attack move.
- The choice of defending has a higher chance of succeeding, there are two choices to defend, one move that will attempt completely evade the attack, and one which will half the damage of the base attack.
- The probability of completely evading all damage has a probabilty of 45%, those said moves from each class are "phase" for speedsters, "invulnerable block" for viltrumites, and "mirror duplicate" for wizards.
- The chances of only suffering half the base damage is 65%, and those moves are "speed dodge" for speedsters, "aerial evasion" for viltrumnites and "mystic shield" for wizards  


## Power Level
- All users start at 150 power level and with every victory, their power levels increase by 30, making them come up against more formiddable opponents in the next fight
- The opponents power level go up to 210, and if the user reaches a power level of 270, they have completed the game
- As the power level increases, the higher damage is dealt on regular moves, along with higher healing properties from both speedsters and wizards 
- The opponents are chosen randomly within the power level class, but they can come against any class in each fight no matter the level. 


## Summary
The user has freedom to choose their name, whether they are a hero or villain and their abilities.Once that has been decided they then fight up to 4 opponents in hopes they can beat them and complete the game, if they are defeated its game over and the program must be restarted.
